versioning

for eg ^4.18.2
1st part = 4
2nd part = 18
3rd part = 2

3rd => Minor fixes(Optional)
2nd part=> Recommended bug fixes(security fix)
1st part=>major relase(can break code/major change)

compatible versions
^4.18.2 => can have anything that starts with 4.18.2 -> <5.0.0
(Intsall all minor fixes and recommended security fixes)

if version has ~,that means change only the 3rd part not even recommended changes 

you can also give ranges for the version in the package.json
